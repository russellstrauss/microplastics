			<h1>Enticing & Thought-Provoking Title</h1>
			
			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>Since the advent of modern polymers such as polyethylene in the 1930’s and polypropylene in the 1950’s, plastics and polymer technologies have had enormous influence over many aspects of societies worldwide. Examples of these include sterilization aids in health and medicine, inexpensive and versatile manufacturing materials, extended microbial preservation through highly-effective seals in the home and food industry, and a large variety of applications in a wide range of other industries.</p>
			
			<p>Many of these attributes of plastics which make it so great and useful are also the same attributes that seem to be causing a growing potential of problems. For example, the production of plastic is so cheap, that manufacturers use it for a large number of disposable products for cost-savings, so enormous quantities are being produced on an ever-growing daily basis—many of these uses lasting for minutes or even seconds before the use of the plastic is terminated and the physical component disposed. This in combination with its amazing ability to resist organic degradation through microbial or fungal decomposition suggest that we should seek mitigation to the problem of such high-production with such low decomposition/destruction rates. In other words, plastics are being produced in exponential rates faster than they can be destroyed, reused, or decomposed.</p>
			<p>New research is showing that these plastics make their way into terrestrial and marine ecosystems where they do not decompose, but break down into tiny pieces (microplastics) over time where wildlife mistakenly ingest the plastics, judging them to be organic matter. These plastics and residual chemicals or toxins eventually make their way into the human diet without knowledge by the human, much like the fish who unknowingly ingested the plastic in the first place. Since many plastics or materials that come in contact with them in industrial settings are toxic to humans, it suggests that the nature of the problem should be explored and we would like to find data to answer more questions in relation to the topic.</p>

			<h2>Production</h2>
			<p>
				Where does it come from?
				
				<ul>
					<li>Who produces the most and where does the plastic begin its lifespan? Show data of plastic manufacturing by country</li>
					
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Use</h2>
			<p>
				How and where does it get used?
				
				<ul>
					<li>Which industries create the most plastic?</li>
					<li>Which countries consume the most?</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Impact</h2>
			<p>
				Where does it end up? How does it get there? Who is impacted the most and what are projections of the impacts with increasing usage? What are potential solutions?
				
				<ul>
					<li>Where does plastic waste get transported?</li>
					<li>Show graphic with different materials (veggies, plastic, styrofoam, paper, etc.) and how many generations the material takes to break down. For example, use estimated breakdown length, such as 450 years for a plastic bottle and show how many generations before that material breaks down.</li>
					<li>Show unit visualization with sushi maki roll that becomes mixed with microplastics based on projections of plastic production.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
