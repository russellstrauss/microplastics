		<h1>The Human Consumption of Microplastics</h1>
		
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>Since the advent of modern polymers such as polyethylene in the 1930’s and polypropylene in the 1950’s, plastics and polymer technologies have had enormous influence over many aspects of societies worldwide. Examples of these include sterilization aids in health and medicine, inexpensive and versatile manufacturing materials, extended microbial preservation through highly-effective seals in the home and food industry, and a large variety of applications in a wide range of other industries.</p>
		
		<p>Many of these attributes of plastics which make it so great and useful are also the same attributes that seem to be causing a growing potential of problems. For example, the production of plastic is so cheap, that manufacturers use it for a large number of disposable products for cost-savings, so enormous quantities are being produced on an ever-growing daily basis—many of these uses lasting for minutes or even seconds before the use of the plastic is terminated and the physical component disposed. This in combination with its amazing ability to resist organic degradation through microbial or fungal decomposition suggest that we should seek mitigation to the problem of such high-production with such low decomposition/destruction rates. In other words, plastics are being produced in exponential rates faster than they can be destroyed, reused, or decomposed.</p>
		<p>New research is showing that these plastics make their way into terrestrial and marine ecosystems where they do not decompose, but break down into tiny pieces (microplastics) over time where wildlife mistakenly ingest the plastics, judging them to be organic matter. These plastics and residual chemicals or toxins eventually make their way into the human diet without knowledge by the human, much like the fish who unknowingly ingested the plastic in the first place. Since many plastics or materials that come in contact with them in industrial settings are toxic to humans, it suggests that the nature of the problem should be explored and we would like to find data to answer more questions in relation to the topic.</p>
		
		<h2>Production</h2>
		<p>Where does it come from?</p>
		
		<h2>Use</h2>
		<p>How and where does it get used?</p>
		
		<h2>Impact</h2>
		<p>Where does it end up? How does it get there? Who is impacted the most and what are projections of the impacts with increasing usage? What are potential solutions?</p>

		<h3>Notes for ideas to add</h3>
		
		<h4>Potential data points to explore</h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What research is available on how much plastic a typical human consumes on average and what percentage of these plastics are toxic to humans?</li>
			<li>Ratios of time plastics are used vs. how long they take to break down or decompose; lifespan use ratios</li>
			<li>Amount of plastic production in various industries</li>
			<li>Different types of plastics, their benefits and downsides</li>
			<li>Plastic production/disposal/improper disposal as related to geographic location or culture</li>
			<li>Do certain foods or habits have more risk to plastic ingestion? Or toxic plastic ingestion?</li>
			<li>Costs of inputs as related to plastic raw material in various industries and products</li>
			<li>Data related to the physical travel of plastics in space-time, whether re-used, disposed in land, or unintentionally into the ocean through the natural flow of water</li>
			<li>Percentage of toxic to humans vs. food safe plastics into the human diet</li>
			<li>Volume/mass of plastics produced since the 1950’s</li>
			<li>How much plastic has been produced overall (high, 70-year scale) vs. decomposed (none, 1000-year scale) since the 1950’s</li>
			<li>Effectiveness and cost of alternatives</li>
			<li>Hopefully many others as we begin to search for and explore data and develop new ideas</li>
